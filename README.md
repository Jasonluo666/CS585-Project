For our project, we will apply Computer Vision concepts to an ongoing neuroscience research project at Boston University. The current researcher records neural activity in the brain of mice and rats while they forage for food. We hope to provide extra analysis to the study through Computer Vision. The final goal of this project is to track the animal head and body regions in a video while the animal is moving through the experimental space.
